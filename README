The reload.vim plug-in automatically reloads various types of Vim scripts as they're being edited in Vim to give you instant feedback on the changes you make. For example while writing a Vim syntax script you can open a split window of the relevant file type and every time you :update your syntax script, reload.vim will refresh the syntax highlighting in the split window. For more information about the plug-in please refer to its homepage or the project page on GitHub:
